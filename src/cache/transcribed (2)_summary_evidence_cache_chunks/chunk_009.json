  "summary": "This chapter discusses temptation bundling, a strategy that can be combined with habit stacking to guide behavior. The formula involves linking a current habit with a needed habit, followed by linking the needed habit with a desired habit. This means doing something you need to do means you get to do something you want to do. Temptation bundling is a way to make habits more attractive by connecting them with something you already want, pairing an action you want to do with an action you need to do.",
