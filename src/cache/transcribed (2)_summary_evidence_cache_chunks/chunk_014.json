  "summary": "This chapter from \"Atomic Habits\" discusses the Law of Least Effort and its impact on behavior. It references Jared Diamond's work in \"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\" highlighting how the east-west orientation of Eurasia facilitated the spread of agriculture compared to the north-south orientation of the Americas, due to similar climates along the same latitude. The chapter introduces the Law of Least Effort, stating that individuals naturally choose the option requiring the least amount of work, and it connects this principle to physics' principle of least action. It emphasizes that people are wired to do what is convenient, influencing the choices they make.",
